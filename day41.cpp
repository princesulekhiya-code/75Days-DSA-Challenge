# 🚀 75 Days DSA Challenge – Day 41  
📚 **Binary Tree Traversal Series (DFS – Recursive & Iterative)**  

Today, I focused on strengthening my understanding of **binary tree traversal techniques**, implementing both **inorder** and **preorder** traversals using **stack (iterative)** and **recursive** approaches. These problems enhanced my grasp of depth-first traversal and tree recursion flow.

## 🧩 Problems Solved  
1️⃣ [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)  
   - Implemented inorder traversal (Left → Root → Right) using both recursive and stack-based methods for better control flow understanding.  

2️⃣ [144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)  
   - Solved preorder traversal (Root → Left → Right) iteratively using stack to simulate recursive behavior.  

---

## 💡 Concepts Covered  
- Recursive & iterative depth-first traversal  
- Stack-based simulation of recursion  
- Understanding traversal order and tree structure  
- Binary tree node manipulation using pointers

## 🧠 Learning  
Working with recursive and iterative tree traversals deepened my understanding of how **stacks handle function calls** internally and how to efficiently **navigate hierarchical data structures** like binary trees.  
These traversal techniques form the foundation for many advanced tree algorithms used in interviews.
