# Day 1: Arrays & Two Pointers

## Problems Solved
1. Two Sum (LeetCode #1)  
   - Approach: HashMap to find pair in O(n).
2. 3 Sum (LeetCode #15)  
   - Approach: Sort + Two Pointers, handle duplicates carefully.
3. 3 Sum Closest (LeetCode #16)  
   - Approach: Sort + Two Pointers, track closest sum.

## Key Learnings
- HashMap can reduce pair search to O(n).
- Sorting + Two Pointers is very powerful for 2/3 sum type problems.
- Handling duplicates and minimizing absolute difference is crucial.
